# GradeTrackingApplication-SQLite-JAVA
This application uses SQLite for data storage and has two screens: Grades screen and Add Course screen. The Grades screen allows the user to view stored courses and grades, delete a course, and add a new course. The screen also displays the overall GPA and number of course hours, which are computed based on the stored courses. The Add Course screen allows the user to enter a new course and add it to the course record. Once added, the screen transitions back to the Grades screen and updates the course list, GPA, and hours displayed on the page
